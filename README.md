# Whitespace Programs

This repository contains two programs written in Whitespace: a "Hello World" program and a simple calculator.

## Description

Whitespace is an esoteric programming language where code is written using only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks), making it challenging to read by humans. It's a fascinating language designed purely for the sake of experimentation and pushing the boundaries of traditional programming paradigms.

## Prerequisites

To execute the programs in this repository, you can use an online Whitespace interpreter such as [this one](https://naokikp.github.io/wsi/whitespace.html).

## Execution Instructions

### For "Hello World" Program:

1. Download the `hello.ws` file from the `src` directory in this repository.
2. Open the file in a text editor or copy its contents.
3. Paste the code into the online Whitespace interpreter.
4. Run the interpreter to see the output.

### For Simple Calculator Program:

1. Download the `calc.ws` file from the `src` directory in this repository.
2. Open the file in a text editor or copy its contents.
3. Paste the code into the online Whitespace interpreter.
4. Run the interpreter to see the output.

## Note:

Whitespace files (.ws) are not displayed in the GitHub preview. They will appear as empty or with minimal content in the code view. However, you can still download the files and view their contents using a text editor or other suitable software.
