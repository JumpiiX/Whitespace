# Whitespace Programs

This repository contains a "Hello World" program written in Whitespace 

## Description

Whitespace is an esoteric programming language where code is written using only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks), making it challenging to read by humans. It's a fascinating language designed purely for the sake of experimentation and pushing the boundaries of traditional programming paradigms.
