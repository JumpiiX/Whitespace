# Whitespace Programs

This repository contains two programs written in Whitespace: a "Hello World" program and a simple calculator.

## Description

Whitespace is an esoteric programming language where code is written using only whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks), making it challenging to read by humans. It's a fascinating language designed purely for the sake of experimentation and pushing the boundaries of traditional programming paradigms.

## Prerequisites

To execute the programs in this repository, you need to have a Whitespace interpreter installed on your system. You can find one [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace_interpreter).

## Execution Instructions

### For "Hello World" Program:

1. Download the `hello.ws` file from the `src` directory in this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `hello.ws` is located.
4. Execute the following command:

```bash
whitespace_interpreter hello.ws
